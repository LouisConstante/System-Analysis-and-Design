# System-Analysis-and-Design
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass is a fictional company that wants to fill a void in the learning market. They want to design a system that will allow customers to receive high-quality training in preparation for the DMV testing.

What did you do particularly well?
The identification of functional requirements is something that I feel was done thoroughly.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could choose one part of these documents to revise, it would be the UML diagrams in the system design document. I would use more variation in my use of relationship arrows to give a full understanding of the concepts in the diagram.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Most of the user's needs were extracted from the mock interview provided in the project resources. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because if the user's needs are not met then the system cannot be considered complete.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing software from an object-oriented perspective. In the future, I will use UML diagrams and other planning tools to design and analyze systems.
